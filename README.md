A multi-threading library that I am developing for my graphics engine svk-lib, the goal is to have my own stylized library to take advantage of vulkan's multi-threading capabilities, however I would also like this to be generalized for use outside of my vulkan library.

I stopped working on this because the c++ standard library already has all this stuff oops.
